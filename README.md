## Overview
![Summary of or model](/results/model.png)
We compared an explainable CNN and traditional GWAS to identify SARS-CoV-2 mutations linked to WHO-labeled Variants of Concern (VOCs). The CNN, combined with SHAP, outperformed GWAS in identifying key nucleotide substitutions, particularly in spike gene regions. Our findings highlight the potential of explainable neural networks as an alternative to traditional genomic analysis methods.
